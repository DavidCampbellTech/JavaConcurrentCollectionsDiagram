# Java 8 Concurrent Collections Diagram / Oracle Certified Java Programmer (OCJP/OCP) Cheat Sheet

Diagram that summarieses the concurrent collections in Java. I originally produced this when studying for my Oracle Certified Programmer (OCJP/OCP) exam(s), but find I refer to it when at work, so I thought I would share it. Any suggestions/corrections/etc, please raise an issue or tweet me @jaymoid.

Thanks ~ James

p.s. the SVG version has working links, and is better quality (but has a larger filesize).
